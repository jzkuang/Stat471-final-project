# Executive Summary

**Problem.** Graduation rates are one of the most used indications of how well a school is developing their students. Schools are essential to the  growth of people in living morally, creatively, and productively in today's society. Despite the national high school graduation rates hitting all-time highs during recent years, some schools are still not seeing the same success. So, for our final project, we have decided to look into the various measures of schools in New York throughout 2019 and analyze which factors were most predictive of high graduation rates in those schools. These factors inform about areas of focus that will contribute most to a school's success in advancing student achievement. Although we are only exploring data encompassed in New York schools, we believe that our results can be extended to schools in other states and the US as due to the variety of schools in New York and their average overall graduation rate. 

**Data.** Our datasets are all pulled from the New York State Education Department (NYSED) and merged together to consider the different types of explanatory variable. A large amount of data for high schools in 2020 were missing, so we focused on 2019. These datasets include both public schools and charter schools and statistics regarding each school's categorized standing, funds and expenditures, characteristics of the staff and students, and the overall demographics of the student population. Our primary response variable will be graduation rate, an illustrative factor of a school's student development.

**Analysis.** Before exploring our data or analyzing it, we split our data into a training and testing dataset, where the testing dataset is utilized for assessing and comparing our statistical model performances. Then, we explore the data to summarize the main characteristics and learn of any correlations between variables. We built 3 different predictive models: ordinary least squares regression, random forest, and boosting. To determine which model was the best predictor, we calculated the root mean squared error for each model, and we determined that the **random forest model???** had the lowest test error. 

**Conclusions.** 

# Introduction

**Background.** High schools are designed as a center of education and development for their students, and their success can oftentimes be measured by their graduation rates. The importance of high school graduation can never be underestimated, as those who graduate can expect better opportunities in their future. The overall graduation rates of high schools in the US has been gradually increasing and reaching all time highs in recent years at 88% for the 2018-2019 academic year. However, high schools that are most successfully getting students through graduation are spread across certain states, and the average state graduation rates can dip down to as low as 75% as a result.^[See High School Graduation Rates By State (2021). usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/see-high-school-graduation-rates-by-state.] Moreover, although overall graduation rates in the US are at all-time highs, there are still states in the US struggling to achieve that same success.             

In addition, the number of individual schools that are considered federally as having low graduation rates, or schools of 100 or more students where fewer than two-thirds earn diplomas in four years, have not been decreasing as overall graduation rates improve. In fact, the number had actually increased in 2016, revealing that it is currently incredibly important to develop methods of improving less successful schools.^[Number of High Schools With Low Graduation Rates Is Rising (2018). https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/number-of-high-schools-with-low-graduation-rates-is-rising/2018/06.] 
These large disparities in graduation rates should be a concern within educational policy, and the solution isn't as easy as simply increasing funding. Many schools are limited in resources, so it is important to identify features that are most predictive of graduation rates. Furthermore, a thorough analysis of graduation rates and their respective schools will highlight the key qualities of schools with high graduation rates. 

**Analysis goals.** Many factors are considered to be indicative of a quality high school, such as teacher/student ratios, effective school leadership, and a supportive teaching environment. Furthermore, by building statistical models, we seek to investigate how important these different features are in determining a high school's graduation rate. We hope to find which types of school features are most predictive of graduation rates, and determine whether these features can be targets of improvement, as variables like student demographics of a school are not feasible to change.

**Signficance.** Our analysis will contribute to finding ways of improving our education system by finding features that are most important to graduation rates. These findings will produce targets for development and reform in our schools, ultimately with the goal of improved student development and opportunities in our society.

positions
  - Teachers teaching out of certification (`PER_OUT_CERT`): Percent of teachers teaching out of their subject/field of
certification

**Students**

- *Characteristics*
